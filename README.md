Script to convert a LiveJournal dump made by [LJBackup](https://gregstoll.com/ljbackup/) to a WordPress-friendly file that can be imported.  For more information, see [the project homepage](https://gregstoll.com/ljbackup/ljtowordpress/) as well as [this thread on the WordPress forums](https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/import-from-livejournal).

This script was created at a time when the WordPress import from LiveJournal was not working - if that's working, you should probably use that instead as it's likely to be better supported.
